# Alfresco Collaboration Tools

This project provides different alternatives to integrate Alfresco Community Edition with Open-Source Online Editing Collaborative services. Despite Alfresco Enterprise provides support for Office 365, Alfresco Community doesn't include this kind feature by default.

Docker Compose templates for easy deployment and testing are provided in the following folders:

* [collabora](collabora) - Alfresco integration with [Collabora Online](https://collaboraonline.github.io)
* [onlyoffice](onlyoffice) - Alfresco integration with [ONLYOFFICE](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/)

>> This project has been designed to test the integrations easily, deploying them in *prod* environments would require additional operations and resources.
